Welcome to the CSBook User Guide. **CSBook is a desktop app for teaching assistants (TAs) to manage their students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are faster at typing, CSBook can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

**CSBook aims to help lessen your workload** of having to create separate spreadsheets or notes to track your students' academic progress. With CSBook, **your students may be organised in a more intuitive manner in custom groups** and **track them and their academic progress in assignments more efficiently**, saving time and letting you get back to your students quicker.

If this is your first time using CSBook, we recommend that you first look at the [How to use](#how-to-use)
section of the user guide.

## Feature List

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Jun Wei`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE`, `t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Optional parameters/fields will be indicated within square brackets.
  e.g. if the command specifies `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL] [g/GROUP_NAME]`, `edit 1 n/Jiaxian` or `edit 1 n/Jiaxian t/@albino_monkey e/e0540014X@u.nus.edu g/CS2103T` are both acceptable commands

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but if you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `t/@albino_monkii t/@albino_api`, only `t/@albino_api` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Format: `help`

#### Clearing all entries : `clear`

#### Saving the data

CSBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually. The data is decrypted by default, but you may encrypt them using the `encrypt` command listed above.

#### Editing the data file

CSBook data are saved as an JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/csbook`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file. 

Note that if the encrypt function is turned on, the data will be saved in an encrypted JSON format. In which case, users are highly advised to decrypt the data file first through the `decrypt` command before editing the data file directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If there are changes to the data file that makes its format invalid, CSBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file on the next run.<br/><br/>

:warning: **Warning**: Do not intentionally change the data file in order to restart CSBook afresh with an empty data file. You should use the `clear` command instead if you want to clear all currently stored data.
